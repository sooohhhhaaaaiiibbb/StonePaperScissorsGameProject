# StonePaperScissorsGameProject
This project is a C++ console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. You can play up to 10 rounds, with results shown after each round and a final summary at the end. The program tracks wins, losses, and draws, making it a fun way to practice C++ basics like enums, structs, and random numbers.
